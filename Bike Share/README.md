# Bike Share Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the bike share activity snapshot data from 2016 in three major cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. The goal is to compare the system usage between these cities and identify any differences within each system based on user types.

## Dataset
 The dataset provides details such as trip duration, start and end times, user types (registered or casual), and more.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- Compare the system usage between New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.
- Analyze the differences in usage patterns between registered users and casual users.
- Gain insights into bike share behavior, including trip durations, popular times, and user preferences.

## Methodology
To achieve these objectives, the following steps will be taken:
1. Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data and identify trends and patterns.
3. Comparative Analysis: Compare the bike share activity between the three cities, considering factors such as trip duration, user types, popular routes, and peak hours.
4. User Type Analysis: Analyze the differences in behavior and usage patterns between registered users and casual users.
5. Visualization: Visualize the findings using appropriate charts and graphs to present insights effectively.
6. Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and provide recommendations based on the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used as the development environment.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the bike share activity data in New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC, this project aims to gain insights into the usage patterns and differences among registered and casual users. The findings can help bike share companies make data-driven decisions to improve their services, optimize bike availability, and target specific user groups to increase sales, improve customer retention, and reduce churn.
