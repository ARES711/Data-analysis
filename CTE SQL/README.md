# Customer Behavior Analysis using SQL Analytical Functions

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing transactions to gain insights into customer behavior. By utilizing SQL analytical functions, we aim to target customers more efficiently and proactively, ultimately increasing sales/revenue, improving customer retention, and reducing churn.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing customer purchasing transactions. The dataset includes information such as customer IDs, transaction dates, and purchase amounts.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the customer purchasing patterns and behavior.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, Monetary.
3. **Revenue Analysis**: Calculate total revenue generated and analyze revenue trends over time.
5. **Churn Prediction**: Utilize analytical functions to predict customer churn and identify at-risk customers.

## SQL Analytical Functions Used

The project utilizes various SQL analytical functions to perform the analysis, including:

- `SUM()`: Calculate the total revenue generated.
- `COUNT()`: Count the number of transactions or customers.
- `PARTITION BY`: Group data by customer IDs or other relevant factors.
- `ORDER BY`: Sort data based on transaction dates or other criteria.

## Conclusion

By leveraging SQL analytical functions, this project enables us to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior and make data-driven decisions. The insights obtained can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive revenue growth.
