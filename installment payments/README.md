## Code Summary

The provided code generates installment payments based on contract details stored in a table. It performs the following steps:

1. It checks the deposit amount and subtracts it from the total fees to determine the remaining amount for installment payments.
2. It determines the payment frequency based on the contract payment type.
3. It calculates the installment amount per month based on the remaining fees and the contract duration.
4. Using a while loop, it inserts installment payment records into a designated table, incrementing the installment number and updating the installment date.
5. The loop continues until the remaining fees are fully allocated.
6. The code assumes the existence of the installment payment table and may require adjustments based on the specific schema and requirements.

This code demonstrates proficiency in SQL cursor usage, conditional checks, mathematical calculations, and database manipulation. It showcases the ability to automate installment payment generation based on contract details.
